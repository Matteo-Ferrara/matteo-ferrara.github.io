  <p>Hey! My name is Matteo.</p>
  <p>I'm a final-year student currently enrolled in a two-year MSc in Finance at Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Milan, Italy).</p>
  <p>I'm very passionate about financial markets and derivatives, and I'm particularly interested in solving financial problems using Python. I'm an entirely self-taught programmer and in the past few years I've developed a few interesting finance-related programs. The projects I'm most proud of are: </p>
  <p><ul>
    <li><a href="https://matteo-ferrara.github.io/option-pricer/">Option Pricer</a>: a simple program to price options using different pricing methods. It currently includes Black-Scholes model, Bachelier model, Binomial Trees and Monte Carlo simulation.</li>
    <li><a href="https://matteo-ferrara.github.io/gex-tracker/">GEX tracker</a>: a small script that automatically scrapes option data from CBOE website and computes dealers' gamma exposure.</li>
  </ul></p>
  <p>In my free time I enjoy watching classic movies, cooking and hiking. I'm very passionate about sports - mainly soccer and Formula 1 - and in the last year, inspired by Netflix's show <i>The Queen's Gambit</i>, I also picked up chess.</p>
